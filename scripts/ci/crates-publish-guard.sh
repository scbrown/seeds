# Called by .github/actions/crates-publish before `cargo publish`.
# It lives in a script rather than inline in the action for one reason: the
# refusals are the safety property, and a refusal that has never been observed
# is a claim. `--selftest` observes all of them.
#
# THE REFUSALS HOLD WITH TRUSTED PUBLISHING FULLY WORKING. It would be easy to
# call this lane safe today because crates.io TP is unconfigured, so a stray
# publish cannot succeed. That is not safety — it is an untested procedure
# standing behind someone else's outage, and it expires silently the moment TP
# is configured. Nothing below consults TP.

#   exit 0  publish may proceed
#   exit 1  refused (the reason is on stderr)
